## OnePot Recipe App

The Recipe App is a web application that allows users to view and manage their favorite recipes. Users can add new recipes, view recipe details, and delete existing and added recipes.

- please refer to the actual files for comments on the code 

## Features

- View Recipe Cards: The app displays recipe cards showing the name, category, and a "View Recipe" button for each recipe.
- View Recipe Details: Clicking on the "View Recipe" button shows the details of the selected recipe, including the name, category, link, preparation time, image, rating, and comments.
- Add New Recipe: Users can add a new recipe by filling out a form with the recipe details, such as name, category, link, preparation time, image URL, rating, and comments.
- Delete Recipe: Users can delete a recipe from the app, which removes it from the list of recipes.

## Iterations

- The overall look and vibe of the website is the same from the web app design 
- Structure: Instead of having the form and recipe details as a pop up when you click on the '+' button, I made it at the bottom of the page
    - This did not affect the functionality of the web app
    - The reason I did this was because of the lack of skills to make a pop up form. I also thought that having everything static on a page further links to the design brief of having a single page architecture

## OnePot Recipe App

The Recipe App is a web application that allows users to view and manage their favorite recipes. Users can add new recipes, view recipe details, and delete existing and added recipes.

## Features

- View Recipe Cards: The app displays recipe cards showing the name, category, and a "View Recipe" button for each recipe.
- View Recipe Details: Clicking on the "View Recipe" button shows the details of the selected recipe, including the name, category, link, preparation time, image, rating, and comments.
- Add New Recipe: Users can add a new recipe by filling out a form with the recipe details, such as name, category, link, preparation time, image URL, rating, and comments.
- Delete Recipe: Users can delete a recipe from the app, which removes it from the list of recipes.

## Iterations

- The overall look and vibe of the website is the same from the web app design 
- Structure: Instead of having the form and recipe details as a pop up when you click on the '+' button, I made it at the bottom of the page
    - This did not affect the functionality of the web app
    - The reason I did this was because of the lack of skills to make a pop up form. I also thought that having everything static on a page further links to the design brief of having a single page architecture

- Things I added: compared to the first web app design iteration, I added some buttons to make the call to action more obvious
    - "View Recipe": I added the 'view recipe' button on the cards so that users are more aware that they can expand the cards and view more details such as the link and comments to the recipe.
    - "Delete": I also added the delete button right next to the 'view recipe' button, so that users can delete the recipe right away without expanding the card first

## Difficulties
I ran into a number of difficulties while coding this recipe web app. I try to resolve them by researching and using various online tools, but it doesn't seem to help. I tried my best resolving them, but it seems that the lack of coding skills is the issue. Here are the things that I had difficulties with:
